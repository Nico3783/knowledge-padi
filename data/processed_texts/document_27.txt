– Access  to international  climate  
finance  is often  mediated  through  
MDBs, requiring  partnership  or 
approval  of national  accredited  
entities . The Clean  Technology  
Fund  (CTF)  as an example,  will 
typically  channel  its funds  through  
the WBG or the AfDB .  Nigeria does  
not currently  have  an Accredited  
Entity  to the major  funds  such  as 
the GCF and AF making  it difficult  
to access  much  needed  funds .
• Small  ticket  size – International  
climate  finance  sources  typically  
require  large -scale  investments  in 
public  projects  (in the order  of 
$10s of millions),  which  makes  it 
challenging  for smaller projects  
and initiatives  to access  funding. 
This requirement  limits  the scope  
of eligible  projects  and tend  to 
overlook  grassroots  opportunities  
and community -based  initiatives .
• Duplication & overlap  – 
Fragmentation  and overlap  among  
different  international  climate  
finance  sources  contribute  to
