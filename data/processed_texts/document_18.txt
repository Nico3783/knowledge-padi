finance  in Nigeria requires  substantial scaling  up to 
align  with  the country's  economic  development  
ambitions  and its Nationally  Determined  Contributions  
(NDC)  adaptation  goals . This is especially  critical  given 
Nigeria's  status  as one of the world's  most  vulnerable  countries  to the impacts  of climate  change  (Verisk  
Maplecroft,  2017). 
Nigerian  climate  finance  is predominantly  debt -based,  
accounting  for over  75% of funding,  with  a primary  
focus  on mitigation  efforts,  although  there is a greater  
emphasis  on adaptation  compared  to the global  
average . While  advocating  for low-carbon  and 
climate -resilient  development offers  substantial  long -
term  economic  benefits  for Nigeria,  winning the public  
debate  on its urgency  and gaining  widespread  support  
from  all stakeholders  is essential  for success.
