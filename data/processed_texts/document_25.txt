and international organisations,  to 
support  climate  change  mitigation  
and adaptation  efforts  in 
developing countries . International  
public  climate  finance  primarily  
originates  from  contributions  made  
by industrialised  countries,  MDBs  
(e.g., World  Bank  Group  (WBG), 
African  Development Bank  (AfDB)), 
and international climate  funds  
(e.g., Green  Climate  Fund  (GCF),  
Global  Environment  Facility  (GEF)). 
This finance  can be part of the

Convention  on Climate  Change  
(UNFCCC)  commitments  made  by 
industrialised  countries  to 
developing countries,  or outside  of 
it.
