 ukniaf.ngCOP28, the 28th Conference of the Parties to the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), marked a critical juncture in global cooperation on climate action. This pivotal conference was tasked with taking stock of progress made to date in achieving the objectives of the 2015 Paris Agreement, especially its goal to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. COP28 intended to go beyond identifying ongoing climate challenges, instead reinforcing international commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, strengthen resilience and adaptation efforts and to enhance sustainable and renewable energy practices.
