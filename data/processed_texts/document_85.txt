Nigeria and UKNIAF at COP28
What did UKNIAF do?
At COP28, we supported Nigeria’s position on 
improving access to sustainable energy and strengthening climate resilience. UKNIAF's 
involvement was marked by its active participation 
in several key areas of negotiation and discussion, reflecting its commitment to fostering sustainable development and climate action.
UKNIAF was represented at the Nigeria pavilion, 
where several side events on climate finance were 
held, including a presentation by the programme. 
These sessions, provided valuable insights and platforms for discussion among Nigerian delegates. 
UKNIAF’s presence underlined its role in informing 
and advancing dialogues and potential partnerships focused on climate finance and sustainable energy practices.
Our engagement at COP28 focussed on the 
principles of Common but Differentiated 
Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR -
RC) and just transition arguments. This
