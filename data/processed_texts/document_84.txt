capabilities and historical contributions of countries to climate change.
At COP , Nigeria was represented by several 
state governors and cabinet members. Nigeria alongside other African nations, called for a just transition that recognised the countryâ€™s developmental needs and the importance of support from developed countries in terms of technology transfer and climate finance. This stance was crucial in advancing the discourse around the Loss and Damage Fund and the broader conversation about climate justice.
Recognising the need to transition away from 
fossil fuels, Nigeria is seeking investments to decarbonise its energy sector while still seeking to leverage its gas resources. This represents a risk which attracted some criticism from some investors and from supporters of a faster transition. Nigeria secured several agreements between agencies and investors and other stakeholders, to assist Nigeria to implement a just energy transition.
