for effective  decision -making  and transparency  and 
accountability . There  is no effective  mechanism  to

finance  in Nigeria either  at the State or Federal

• Federal  and State  budget  allocation  – Federal and 
State governments  allocate  finance  on an annual  
cycle,  based  on the investment submissions from  
Federal and State  Agencies . Securing budget  from  
these  sources requires  engaging  with  the relevant  
MDA .
• Sovereign Green  Bond  – Nigeria has issued  2 
sovereign  green  bonds  and is currently  developing a 
third . The current  sovereign  bond  is allocated  through 
the budget  process . The allocation  of proceeds  and 
selection  of projects  happens  based  on the federal  
budget  allocations . Accessing  this source  requires  
securing  allocation  through  the annual  budget  
process .
