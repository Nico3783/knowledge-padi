Key challenges and barriers
All the challenges  facing  domestic  private  finance  
apply  to international public  finance,  as the main  
financing  instruments  deployed  (e.g. debt,  equity,  
guarantees)  operate  through  domestic  private  finance  
institutions . In addition,  it’s worth  noting the following :
• Foreign  exchange  & inflation risk – Nigeria’s  volatile  
exchange rates  and high  inflation  rates,  especially  in 
recent times,  pose  significant  risks  to international  investors .  Currency  fluctuations  and inflation  have  
eroded  the value  of investment  and inflate  project  
costs,  thus  discouraging  investors  from  allocating  
capital to long- term  climate  projects .
• Scale  & accessibility – International  climate  finance  
tends  to involve  larger- scale  investments,  given  its 
global  scope  and the need  to address  systemic  climate  
challenges .
