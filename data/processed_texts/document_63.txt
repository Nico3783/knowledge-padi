What did we learn? 
A clear description of the roles & responsibilities of 
the different actors in the process is crucial. 
The roles and responsibilities of different actors were an 
issue raised at the start of the pilot, and the team, with UKNAF coordination, needed to revisit it as work progressed to navigate potential conflicts.
UKNIAF conceptualised  and managed the project and 
provided general coordination across the project timeline. Other parties were the beneficiary, the operator, and the mini -grid developer.
All parties must agree on a workable commercial 
structure from the beginning. 
The commercial structure could be based on an existing tariff framework or some other parameters if all parties agree.
With the UKNAF pilot, the Multi -Year Tariff Order (MYTO) 
and the Mini -Grid Regulations, designed by the Nigerian 
Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), provided a sound 
basis for commercial discussions between the parties.
