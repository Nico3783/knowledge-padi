What was COP28 about?
What was Nigeriaâ€™s role?
Nigeria is the second largest African oil and gas producer, and the sixth largest in OPEC. Its export economy and tax revenue are dominated by the fossil fuel industry and the country walks a delicate path between economic development and environmental stewardship , as seen in its NDC goals which 
has ambitious goals. Against a backdrop of 
significant macro -economic upheaval, the 
government has moved to recognize the centrality of action on climate change and just transition.
In this light, Nigeria's stance at COP28 was a 
blend of advocacy for equitable climate finance, proactive planning for energy transition, and navigating the complexities of global climate politics. Its overall approach was shaped by the principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR -RC), considering the varying 
capabilities and historical contributions of countries to climate change.
