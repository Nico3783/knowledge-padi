HOW DOES THE CHANGING CLIMATE AFFECT
ELECTRICITY INFRASTRUCTURE?
EXTREME AND IRREGULAR WEATHER
Can cause damage to power lines, transformers,
substations, and other components of the power grid,
leading to power outages and disruptions in service.MORE FREQUENT AND INTENSE
STORMS AND FLOODS
RISING TEMPERATURES
Can strain power generation and transmission systems,
leading to overheating and potential  equipment failure;
reduce efficiency.INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR POWER, ESPECIALLY
FOR AIR CONDITIONING AND REFRIGERATION
RISING SEA LEVELS
SALTWATER INTRUSION AND STORM SURGES
CHANGES IN PRECIPITATION PATTERNS
Droughts reduce water levels; lower capacity of
hydropower plants to generate electricity. 
More precipitation can lead to flooding, which can
damage hydropower facilities and disrupt operations.PRECIPITATION PATTERNS AND DROUGHTS
