Climate -aligned  investments  are risky  because  projects  are often  
novel  or unproven  from  a financing  perspective . Public  and 
concessional  sources  have  a larger appetite  for this sort of risk – 
but lack the scale  of capital required,  so are unable  to fully  fund  
major  projects . The private  sector  has the capital but lacks  the 
risk appetite  and wants  a clearer return . By structuring  an 
investment  to engage  both  types  of investors,  a project  can 
become  more  financeable  overall. For example,  public  finance  
can take on more  of the early  stage  risk, or a discrete  portion  of 
the project  could  be isolated  for private  financing  – which  can 
make  an investment  more  attractive  to a private  investor .
