and the Mini -Grid Regulations, designed by the Nigerian 
Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), provided a sound 
basis for commercial discussions between the parties.
The NERC Mini -grid Regulation establishes a procedure for 
determining the tariff for mini -grids â€”either using the Multi -
Year Tariff Order (MYTO) methodology agreed to by all the 
parties and approved by NERC or set by the agreement between the registered micro -grid operator and the 
community. This is provided that at least sixty percent (60%) of the customers within the community consent to the pricing. In determining the tariff, it is now also important to factor in interconnection costs and projected revenue from the export/import of power from the grid.
Clear regulatory guidelines need to be in place
