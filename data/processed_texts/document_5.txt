Financing development priorities through climate 
finance
While  the most  populous  and 
economically  significant  country  
in Africa,  Nigeria  faces  a 
perpetual  shortfall in investment . 
Climate  finance  can play an 
important  role towards  closing  
the gap,  driving  positive  
environmental  and social  impact  
while  unlocking  new  
opportunities  for attracting  
investment  and innovation  to 
Nigeria and improving  resilience  
to the many  climate -related  risks  
that it faces .
• Infrastructure  Development : 
Many  of Nigeria’s  infrastructure  
needs  are aligned  with  climate  
change,  such  as renewable  
energy  installations,  climate -
smart  agriculture  projects, and 
resilient  transportation  systems.
