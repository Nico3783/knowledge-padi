In this instance anecdotal evidence suggests that the 
passage of the Electricity Act was not widely anticipated at that time, despite a well -known need and ongoing 
conversations. UKNIAF was focused on other energy transition indicators at the time, but the programme quickly linked this work to sub -national markets and the broader 
energy transition. 
Nigeriaâ€™s compliance with agreed global and national 
transition goals can only work when the States are aware of national policy commitments and can take concrete steps to address them. Therefore, setting up sub -national markets 
presents an opportunity to integrate national low -carbon 
transition targets into State - level planning and action. 
Experience & reputation underpin success.
