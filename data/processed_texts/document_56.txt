Flexibility in programming often leads to trade -offs, which 
require reallocation of programme resources, risking the non-delivery of planned and anticipated results.
Together with other stakeholders UKNIAF used a programme risk matrix to identify risks and their corresponding mitigation measures. This approach allowed the programme to cooperatively examine various risks, including delivery and reputational risks. This process enabled the programme and partner institutions to be more reflective and fostered a shared understanding of potential challenges that could impact delivery within the agreed timelines.
