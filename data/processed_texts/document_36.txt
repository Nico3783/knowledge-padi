• Scale  & accessibility – International  climate  finance  
tends  to involve  larger- scale  investments,  given  its 
global  scope  and the need  to address  systemic  climate  
challenges . 
• Policy & regulatory  framework  – International  
climate  finance  often  operates  within  a framework  of 
international agreements,  conventions,  and protocols,  
which  set guidelines  and principles  for climate  finance  
governance  and accountability . Nigeria,  with  a 
government  dependent  on revenue  and forex  from  
the oil and gas sector,  the requirement  to align  with  
international criteria  and standards  on 
decarbonization  makes  accessing  international climate  
finance  more  challenging .
