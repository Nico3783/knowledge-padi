emerging  economies,  such as South  Africa,  have  not 
yet materialised,  which  puts  renewed  focus  on the 
ongoing international climate  change  negotiations  to

Despite  the substantial  volume  of global  climate  
finance  available,  Nigeria receives  only  a fraction  of 
this funding,  totalling  about  USD  1.9 billion  in 
2019/ 2020. Of the total  USD  1.9 billion,  adaptation  
finance  accounted  for USD  663 million,  while  
mitigation  finance  amounted  to USD  1.1 billion,  with  
an additional  USD  186 million  allocated  for dual -
benefits  finance . In line with  global trends,  adaptation  
finance  in Nigeria requires  substantial scaling  up to 
align  with  the country's  economic  development  
ambitions  and its Nationally  Determined  Contributions
